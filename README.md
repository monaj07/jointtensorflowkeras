### What is this repository for? ###

* I am going to learn how to use tensorflow and keras in one session.
* Version 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###

1. First, implement a pure tensorflow code for a simple task, like MNIST digit recognition.
2. Do the same thing in pure Keras
3. Save the weights of the trained tensorflow network.
4. See if you can load them in Keras, based on the instruction in: https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/5273
5. a: Modify the pure tensorflow network by re-defining some layers using Keras. b: Then train the network using Tensorflow optimizer.
6. See if you can load the weights of the trained tensorflow network (obtained in step 3) onto the joint Keras-Tensorflow network (as you have defined in 5-a)
