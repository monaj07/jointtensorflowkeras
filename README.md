### What is this repository for? ###

* I am going to learn how to use tensorflow and keras in one session.
* Version 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###

1. First, implement a pure tensorflow code for a simple task, like MNIST digit recognition.
2. Do the same thing in pure Keras
3. a: Modify the pure tensorflow network by defining the model using Keras. b: Then train the network using Tensorflow optimizer.
4. See if you can load the learned weights of a Tensorflow model onto a pure Keras model (the one defined in step 2).
In other words, run the tensorflow optimization and train the network and then build a pure Keras model and set its weights using the learned weights of the Tensorflow model.
