### What is this repository for? ###

* I am going to learn how to use tensorflow and keras in one session.
* Version 0.1

### How do I get set up? ###

1. First, implement a pure tensorflow code for a simple task, like MNIST digit recognition.
2. Save the weights of the trained network.
3. Modify the previous network by re-defining some layers using Keras.Then train the network using Tensorflow optimizer.
4. Grab the weights learned in the pure-Tensorflow network (step 2), and see if you can load them in the Keras-Tensorflow network (in step 3). See if you get a similar result.
